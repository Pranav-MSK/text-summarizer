# Gisty – Instant Text Summarizer

Gisty is a lightweight web app that summarizes text instantly using **Chrome’s Built-in AI (Gemini Nano)**. It provides fast, privacy-friendly summaries directly in your browser, and gracefully falls back to a local summarizer if the AI API isn’t available. This project is my submission to Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025.
